                    <h3>Edits to the coding of your website</h3>
                    <p>Even though most websites are written in a common programming language (html) – different designers use their own variations of the language, which slows down the speed that edits can be made by us.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The text and images you may have utilised on your website are very useful and can continue to be used</li>
                        <li>However, the (html) coding that your previous web-designers may have used to get your text and images to display may not be so great and in some cases, could benefit from an overhaul</li>
                        <li>If your website is a basic, mainly static html website, then it is possible that small edits can be made with ease and should not cost much.</li>
                        <li>However, if your website is very large or contains animations, galleries, interactive elements or quote forms, then it’s likely that edits will cost much less if the same work was being done on an Alloy website.</li>

                <h4> Why are additions and edits to a CMS website often cheaper than with Static HTML websites? </h4>
                <div class="q3-detail">
                    <h3>Whats the difference?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Edits or additions to Static HTML websites are done through a code editor that requires you to update every file on the website upon each edit.</li>
                        <li>CMS websites allow you to create single files to control the appearance of pages, then dynamically inject content into these pages to rapidly create multiple different pages with an identical layout.</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <p>As an example, if you wanted to add a portfolio to your website, of say 6 projects including a projects summary page + 6 individual project pages.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To code in static HTML this would cost approx 7 x £40 per page = £280</li>
                        <li>To code in a CMS website costs approx £100 to create the templates then add 6x £10per page to create the portfolio items = £160</li>

                <p>Some people prefer to skip over the minor details and focus on the bigger picture. At Alloy, we believe the bigger picture is a mosaic; it only makes sense when all of the minor details work together in harmony. In practise this means before we get going we always take the time to get to know you and your business. We build up a well rounded understanding of what it is you do and what makes your business special.<br>By first learning as much about the business as possible, our knowledge can filter through to every level of the website design, from the graphics and colour palette, through to the copywriting and menu presentation. Over the years our team have worked with clients from a huge variety of industries; fitness, cleaning, food, drinks, entertainment and more. Chances are we already have some experience working in your market or field, but we never take this experience for granted. Every business is different and getting to know each client remains a vital part of the web design process.</p>
